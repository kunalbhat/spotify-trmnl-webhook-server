This project exposes a lightweight serverless API that returns a JSON payload of your **recently played Spotify tracks**, formatted for use in a [TRMNL](https://usetrmnl.com/) private plugin. TRMNL polls the endpoint periodically and displays an album art grid on the device.

## Tech Stack

- **Vercel Serverless Function** (`api/spotify.js`)
- **Spotify Web API** (OAuth with refresh token)
- **JSON output** formatted to TRMNL’s expected schema
- No front-end or Express server required

---

## What It Does

- Authenticates via Spotify refresh token
- Fetches the last 10 recently played tracks
- Transforms data into:
  - `title`: track name
  - `subtitle`: artist(s)
  - `image_url`: album cover
  - `meta`: timestamp (played_at)
- Returns as JSON at a public `/api/spotify` endpoint

### Example Output

```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "title": "Peace Piece",
      "subtitle": "Bill Evans",
      "image_url": "https://...",
      "meta": "7/14/2025, 2:10 PM"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Example Use Case

The plugin can be configured in TRMNL with polling every 5–15 minutes, rendering a grid wall of album art with track info underneath — ideal for a semi-static visual display that evolves throughout the day.

## Setup

1. Clone this repo
2. Add a `.env` file locally (or define in Vercel Dashboard):

   ```env
   SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id
   SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret
   SPOTIFY_REFRESH_TOKEN=your_refresh_token
   ```

3. Deploy to [Vercel](https://vercel.com)
4. Use your live endpoint in your TRMNL plugin:

   ```
   https://your-app.vercel.app/api/spotify
   ```
